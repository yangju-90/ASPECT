<br>Here we provide a sample code (Code/regression.py) for producing **100-m resolution Age-Stratified Population Estimation from the 2020 China Census by Township (ASPECT)**. The dataset is available at (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.27323106.v1).<br/>
<br>ASPECT is produced with township-level census data. However, the township boundaries are **currently not accessible** from the National Platform for Common Geospatial Information Services (https://www.tianditu.gov.cn/), we are therefore not able to share them and associated data publicly. 
We instead provide a toy dataset using **county-level data from East China** as a demonstration for our code producing ASPECT.<br/> To run this code, make sure you download this repository and download the input files.<br/>
